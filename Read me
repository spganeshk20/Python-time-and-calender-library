Hi friend, 
Here your buddy Ganesh, who use to make your work ease and helps you to complete your work within a seconds

Important point to consider: Use python 2.7 to run this code


I am describing the list of functions available in this library - "system_time"

Library usage details:
you can call the method available in this library by the following syntax

Syntax is: system_time."any function name" 

Once you call any function - It will return you the string value.
store it in some variable and do your operations

Example code:
current_date=system_time.date() ; #current_date is a variable. created by your buddy for demonstration purpose
print(current_date);

Available methods on date and time are
1. date_time_all() - return the current system date and time in 24hr format

2. date_y_m_d() - return the date (Year-Month-Date)


3. date_d() - return the date interms of number
4. month_m() - return the month as a number
5. year_y() - return the year interms of number 

6. day_word() - return the current day in terms of characters
7. month_word - return the month interms of character


8. time()_24 - return the current system time (Hour-Minutes-Seconds) in 24hr format
9. time()_24_h_m - return the current system time (Hour-Minutes) in 24hr format

10. time_12() - return the current time in 12-hour format (Hour-Minutes-Seconds) with am and pm indication too
11. time_12_h_m_s() - return the current system time in 12-hour format (Hour-Minutes-Seconds) and no am, pm indication
12. time_12_h_m() - return the current time in 12-hour format (Hour-Minutes) and no am,pm indication
13. time_12_am_pm - return the current time status as either am and pm 



To access the calender, syntax should be as follows

Syntax is: system_time.calender_disp(year, month)

calender syntax explanation - "pass two arguments. first one should be year and second one is month (month value starts from 1 to 12, whereas 1 represents January and 12 represents december), should be two arugments"

after this store it some variable and do your operations
